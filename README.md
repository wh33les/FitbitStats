# Fitbit stats project

Project for the spring 2023 data visualization minicourse from the Erd√∂s Institute.  I used the Fitbit data from the first year I had the Fitbit to make a dashboard with my exercise each day, how it affected my resting heart rate, and how it affected my sleep.  I completed this project in 11 days, with very little experience with JavaScript, and no experience with d3.js.

## What's in the files

The data I exported from Fitbit contained a lot of files, some .csv, some .json, some with data for the month, some with data for the day.  In the RawData folder I compiled several data categories into single files for the year using Python.  Then I used Python to clean the data and prepare it for use with d3.js, those files are in the CleanedData folder.
