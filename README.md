# Fitbit Stats Project

Project for the spring 2023 data visualization minicourse from the Erd√∂s Institute.  I used the Fitbit data from the first year I had the Fitbit to make a dashboard with my exercise each day, how it affected my resting heart rate, and how it affected my sleep.  I completed this project in 11 days, with very little experience with JavaScript, and no experience with d3.js.
