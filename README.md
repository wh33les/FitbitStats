# Fitbit stats project

Spring 2023 data visualization project from the Erd&#337;s Institute. Using data from my first year with Fitbit, I created a dashboard that visualizes daily exercise, its impact on resting heart rate, and its effects on sleep patterns. This project was completed in just 11 days with minimal JavaScript experience and no prior knowledge of d3.js.

**Project Files:**
- RawData: Contains the original Fitbit data, including both .csv and .json files. I used Python to compile various data categories into yearly files.
- CleanedData: After cleaning the raw data using Python, these files were prepared for visualization with d3.js.

Explore this project to see how I transformed raw Fitbit data into actionable insights using data visualization techniques.
